# ironback

## Getting started

**DISCLAIMER: It doesn't run on older version of Git Bash (from version 2.41.0.windows.3 seems ok) otherwise you need to use a real TTY (Teletypewriter)**

```bash
$ npx ironback
```

## CLI

```
$ npx ironback --help

  Usage
  $ ironback

  Then you need to choose the project type and the project name.
  Ironback will install the dependencies for you.
  After that you just have to cd into your newly created project and start codingðŸ’™
```
